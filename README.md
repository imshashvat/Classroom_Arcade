# 🎮 CLASSROOM ARCADE — TEACHER SOS 2.0

**CLASSROOM ARCADE** is a revolutionary **AI gaming system** that transforms a regular classroom into a **live battle arena** where students learn through **fast, addictive mini-games** (Relay Battle, Survival Arena, Treasure Hunt, etc.).  
Instead of “activities”, we convert **every lesson into a game** so that **45 minutes feels like 5**.

> **Vision:** Kids learn for 3+ hours daily without realizing — because learning feels like play.
